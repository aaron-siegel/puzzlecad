  Assemble the six pieces into a 3x3x3 cube.

  _Design No. 78-A_ is a sort of sequel to Coffin's related design ${link:coffin.pillars-of-hercules}. Like _Pillars of Hercules_, it is based on an unusual dissection of the cube into half-cubes, this time with all six pieces containing a dissected component.

  This design is an obscure one and has rarely been produced. Coffin himself had little to say about it, remarking only that "If the three [composite] pieces are joined together at the start, the puzzle cannot be assembled." Despite its neglect, it's a fine and unique design, and I had a lot of fun solving it. Recommended to anyone interested in exploring the byways of Coffin's catalog.

  Aside from _Pillars of Hercules_, other Coffin designs that use the same concept include ${link:coffin.pieces-of-eight} and ${link:coffin.triple-cross}.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy of `coffin.78-a.pieces.stl`. You may optionally print `coffin.78-a.box.stl`, a display box that can hold the assembled puzzle in place, as shown in the cover photo.

  This model uses "snap joints" so that it can be printed without supports. ${snap-joints-boilerplate}

  I've also included a smaller version, `coffin.78-a.pieces-smaller.stl`, that uses around 1/3 less material.
