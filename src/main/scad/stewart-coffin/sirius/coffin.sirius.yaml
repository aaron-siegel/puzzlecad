description: |
    _Sirius_ is the first and simplest puzzle in a long line of related designs by Stewart Coffin. It consists of six interlocking pieces, each identical in shape but with various color permutations, that assemble into a star-like interlocking shape. (Mathematically, it has the shape of the first stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron.)
    
    The interlocking mechanism predates Coffin; his innovation was to introduce a color scheme that yields the striking color symmetries shown in the photos. While there are many ways to assemble the six pieces, just two of them have three-fold color symmetry. They are shown in the first two images.
    
    ### Printing Instructions
    
    Print six copies of `coffin.sirius.stl`, two each in three different colors. Then assemble the pieces as shown in the third image: pair each color base with exactly one color tip, so that you wind up with three sets of two _identical_ pieces. You _must_ assemble them this way, or you will not achieve the intended color configuration.
    
    The pieces are assembled from multiple colors using "snap joints": simply snap the male and female connectors into place. If they come out too loose, they can be reinforced with a few drops of superglue (but this usually isn't necessary).
