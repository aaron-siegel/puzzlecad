  Assemble the three pieces into the pyramid shape shown in the photo.
  
  _Three-Piece Block_ is one of Coffin's most recognizable designs. It's surprisingly difficult despite having only three pieces, due to the unusual shape of the assembly. I can recommend it highly to anyone with an interest in interlocking mechanical puzzles.

  Coffin tells the interesting story of the origins of this puzzle:
  
  "I dashed off the design of this simple puzzle in response to a request from a New York advertising agency, whose client, Citibank, wanted hundreds of them for use in some sort of sales promotion scheme. The base of it presumably resembles Citibankâ€™s corporate logo. I also made some for general sales. What a surprise it was when friends started reporting it was one of their favorite puzzles, much more confusing than I had at first assumed."

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy of `coffin.three-piece-block.stl`. This model uses snap joints so that the pieces can be printed without supports; for this particular puzzle, I recommend using a sturdy PLA filament (or something stronger, such as PLA+ or ABS) and/or reinforcing with glue, due to the fragile nature of some of the joints.

  For a slightly smaller version that uses less material, you can print `coffin.three-piece-block-smaller.stl` instead.
