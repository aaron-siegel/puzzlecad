description: |
  Pack six pieces into an obstructed tray.

  _Decoy_ is a tray-packing puzzle that looks simple, yet is anything but. You will need to find some tricky movements in order to get all the pieces into place. Coffin called this his favorite of his obstructed-tray puzzles, and it's surely the most difficult.

  The top of the tray is modeled with a semi-transparent thatched pattern, so that you can more easily see what's happening inside. The pattern is purely aesthetic and is not relevant to the puzzle itself.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.pieces.stl` and `${name}.tray.stl`. After printing, you will first need to assemble the tray, before attempting to solve the puzzle. The tray has four glue holes, one in each corner, and the tray cap has four pegs that fit into the glue holes. Put a drop of super glue into each glue hole, mount the tray cap securely onto the tray, and wait for the glue to dry. Then you're ready to attempt the puzzle!
