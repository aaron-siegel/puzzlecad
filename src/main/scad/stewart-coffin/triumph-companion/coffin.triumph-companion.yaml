  _Triumph Companion_ is a sequel of sorts to Coffin's related design [Triumph](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4195865). Like _Triumph_, it consists of six pieces that assemble in various ways to form interesting polyhedral structures. Coffin wrote of this puzzle:

  "Details on the _Triumph Companion_, if they ever existed, seem to have become lost. Perhaps that makes it all the more fun. ... My old notes indicate that it has eight symmetrical solutions, but I can find no description of them, so we leave it to the curious reader to fashion a working model and figure them out. I am guessing that the name suggests the possibility of combining it with _Triumph_ pieces to create yet more sculptural possibilities."

  Well, I'm excited to resurrect this design and enable anyone with a 3D printer to easily fashion a working model. One of the symmetrical assemblies is shown in the cover photo; discovery of the others is left to the reader. _Triumph Companion_ is modeled to the exact same proportions and specifications as _Triumph_, so the two designs can be combined into a larger set of twelve interchangeable pieces.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print three copies each of `coffin.triumph-companion.bases.stl` and `coffin.triumph-companion.tips.stl`. Use one filament color for the bases and a different filament color for the tips.

  This puzzle uses "snap joints" so that it can be printed in multiple colors. After you print it, first connect all the joints before attempting to solve the puzzle. Snap each male connector into a corresponding female connector (for example, the male connector labeled "A" should connect to the female connector with a matching "A" label on the interior). If they come out too loose, they can be reinforced with a few drops of superglue, but this usually isn't necessary. The joints are designed to be printed without supports.

  Optionally, you may print `coffin.triumph-companion.bases-larger.stl` and `coffin.triumph-companion.tips-larger.stl` for a grander version of the puzzle, which will use around 50% more material.
