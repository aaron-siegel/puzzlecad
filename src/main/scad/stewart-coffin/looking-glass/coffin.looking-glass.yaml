description: |
  Pack six pieces into an obstructed tray.

  _Looking Glass_ is one of many tray-packing puzzles by Stewart Coffin. It's somewhat unusual in that the pieces enter through a slit in the side of the tray, rather than through the top of the tray. It's similar to Coffin's related design ${link:coffin.window-pain}; but in _Looking Glass_ the slit on the side is the _only_ way in.

  The top of the tray is modeled with a semi-transparent thatched pattern with a large finger-hole in the center, so that you can more easily manipulate the pieces and see what's happening inside. The pattern and finger-hole are purely aesthetic and are not relevant to the puzzle itself.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.pieces.stl` and `${name}.tray.stl`. After printing, you will first need to assemble the tray, before attempting to solve the puzzle. The tray has five glue holes, and the tray cap has five pegs that fit into the glue holes. Put a drop of super glue into each glue hole, mount the tray cap securely onto the tray, and wait for the glue to dry. Then you're ready to attempt the puzzle!
