  Fit all four pieces into the rectangular opening.

  _Four Fit_ is a classic packing puzzle. It seems impossible at first, but it isn't... if it seems like the pieces just won't fit the way you expect, or the tray size is just a little bit off... don't worry! There's nothing wrong with the model or your printer. Keep trying.
  
  _Four Fit_ is one of a series of tray-packing puzzles, and Coffin regards it as one of his best. (The others in the series can be found via the links below.) [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner), the renowned popularizer of mathematics, remarked in a letter to Coffin: "Itâ€™s the finest dissection puzzle of all time. It looks easy but is fiendishly difficult. I wasted a week trying vainly to solve it." Gardner's frustrations with this puzzle earned it the nickname _Martin's Menace_.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `coffin.four-fit.pieces.stl` and `coffin.four-fit.tray.stl`. Optionally, you may print `coffin.four-fit.lid.stl` as well, which is a lid that fits over the tray for easy storage.
