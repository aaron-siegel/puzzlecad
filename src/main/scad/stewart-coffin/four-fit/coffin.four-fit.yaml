  _Four Fit_ is an absolute classic, and ${stewart-coffin-tray-packing}
  
  Coffin regards _Four Fit_ as one of his best designs. [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner), the renowned popularizer of mathematics, remarked in a letter to Coffin: "Itâ€™s the finest dissection puzzle of all time. It looks easy but is fiendishly difficult. I wasted a week trying vainly to solve it." Gardner's frustrations with this puzzle earned it the nickname _Martin's Menace_.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.pieces.stl` and `${name}.tray.stl`. Optionally, you may print `${name}.lid.stl` as well, which is a lid that fits over the tray for easy storage.
