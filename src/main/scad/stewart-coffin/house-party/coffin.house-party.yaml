description: |
  Fit all four pieces into each of the two house-shaped openings. They look similar, but the solutions are quite different! One of the openings seems much larger than the other, but it's just a little bit narrower, and it's not clear at all what to do about it ...
  
  _House Party_ is one of a series of tray-packing puzzles by Stewart Coffin. (The other puzzles in the series can be found on the [Stewart Coffin Puzzles](https://www.puzzlehub.org/puzzles/stewart-coffin) collection page.) It's a sequel of sorts to ${link:coffin.housing-project}, but more difficult, and was initially presented for exchange at the International Puzzle Party 30 in Japan in 2010. If you're unfamiliar with Coffin's tray-packing puzzles, I'd recommend starting with one of the others first; the linked collection page has some recommendations.
  
  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.pieces.stl` and `${name}.tray.stl`. Optionally, you may print `${name}.lid.stl` as well, which is a lid that fits over the tray for easy storage.
