    Assemble the seven pieces into a 4x4x4 cube.
    
    This is one of Stewart Coffin's classic designs. It was a pioneering 4x4x4 interlocking cube - a puzzle genre that has become extremely successful over the years - and it still holds up as a brilliant and beautiful design, a fine challenge with some surprising movements. Coffin considers it inferior to his later designs [Involution](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3360935) and especially [Involute](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3351486), but it remains popular today and is an essential part of his canon.
    
    UPDATED March 2020 with a new design and larger size.

    ### Printing Instructions
    
    Two versions are provided, a four-color version and a single-color version. The multicolor version uses "snap joints" to enable each piece to be printed in several components with different colors (see below for details). It's the preferred version and is the one shown in the photo. The single-color version lacks the aesthetic properties of the multicolor one, but it is designed to be relatively easy to print.
    
    To print the four-color version, print `coffin.convolution.color-1.stl` through `coffin.convolution.color-4.stl` each in a different filament color; colors 1 through 3 will appear on the "windmill" patterns on the cube faces, and color 4 will appear on the corners. You can also print a two-color version by using the same color for `color-1` through `color-3`.
    
    To print the single-color version, print `coffin.convolution.single-color.stl`. There is also a smaller variant provided, `coffin.convolution.single-color-smaller.stl`, which will use around half as much material.
