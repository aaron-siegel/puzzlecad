    Assemble six identical pieces into the polyhedral shape shown in the cover photo.

    _Vega_ is an interlocking design by Stewart Coffin that is as much polyhedral sculpture as puzzle. The mechanism of assembly is identical to Coffin's earlier [Sirius](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4122252) and other related designs, so _Vega_ will not provide much of an assembly challenge to the experienced puzzle solver. Once assembled, though, it is a magnificent display piece - geometric sculptural art that comes apart.
    
    ### Printing Instructions
    
    Print six copies of `coffin.vega.base.stl` and twelve copies of `coffin.vega.tip.stl`. Use one filament color for the bases and one (different) color for the tips. Then snap the tips onto the bases (before attempting to solve the puzzle).
    
    The pieces are assembled using "snap joints": simply snap the male and female connectors into place. If they come out too loose, they can be reinforced with a few drops of superglue, but this usually isn't necessary. The joints are designed to be printed without supports.
