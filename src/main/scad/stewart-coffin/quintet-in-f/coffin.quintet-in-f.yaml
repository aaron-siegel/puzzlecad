  _Quintet in F_ is my personal favorite in the series, and I can recommend it to anyone. If you're not familiar with this type of puzzle, though, I'd recommend starting with one of the others first; the linked collection page has some recommendations.
  
  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.pieces.stl` and `${name}.tray.stl`. Optionally, you may print `${name}.lid.stl` as well, which is a lid that fits over the tray for easy storage.
