  Assemble the four pieces into any of three symmetric polyhedral shapes.

  _Fusion-Confusion_ is a modification of Coffin's earlier design [Triumph](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4195865), in which two pairs of pieces are permanently "fused" together. This makes the assembly considerably more challenging. There are three distinct symmetric shapes that can be formed; try to find them all! (They're the same three shapes obtainable with the basic _Triumph_ set, though with different color patterns, owing to the variant color symmetry employed in _Fusion-Confusion_.) Coffin wrote:

  "In a rare flash of lucky inspiration, I created _Fusion-Confusion_ by joining two pairs of _Triumph_ pieces together in a particular way, resulting in only four pieces but ever so much more potential for recreation. For a start, three of the four axes of assembly are eliminated, leaving only one confusing diagonal axis. The object is to assemble into any one of three shapes having a three-fold axis of symmetry (or four solutions if you count mirror images). There are in addition 12 assemblies that produce nondescript shapes."

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `coffin.fusion-confusion.bases.stl` and `coffin.fusion-confusion.tips.stl`. Use one filament color for the bases and a different filament color for the tips.

  This puzzle uses "snap joints" so that it can be printed in multiple colors. After you print it, first connect all the joints before attempting to solve the puzzle. Snap each male connector into a corresponding female connector (for example, each male connector labeled "A" should connect to a female connector with a matching "A" label on the interior). If they come out too loose, they can be reinforced with a few drops of superglue, but this usually isn't necessary. The joints are designed to be printed without supports.

  Optionally, you may print `coffin.fusion-confusion.bases-larger.stl` and `coffin.fusion-confusion.tips-larger.stl` for a grander version of the puzzle, which will use around 50% more material.
