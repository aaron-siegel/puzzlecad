  _Octet in F_ ${stewart-coffin-tray-packing}
  
  _Octet in F_ is a sequel of sorts to Coffin's earlier design ${link:coffin.quintet-in-f}. It's one of the more difficult puzzles in the series; if you're not familiar with this type of puzzle, I'd recommend starting with one of the others instead; the linked collection page has some recommendations.
  
  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.pieces.stl` and `${name}.tray.stl`. Optionally, you may print `${name}.lid.stl` as well, which is a lid that fits over the tray for easy storage.
