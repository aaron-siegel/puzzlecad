description: |
  Two puzzles in one: it all five pieces into each of the two house-shaped openings. They look similar, but the solutions are quite different!

  _Housing Project_ is one of a series of tray-packing puzzles by Stewart Coffin. (The other puzzles in the series can be found on the [Stewart Coffin Puzzles](https://www.puzzlehub.org/puzzles/stewart-coffin) collection page.) It was originally presented for exchange at the International Puzzle Party 23 in 2003. If you're unfamiliar with Coffin's tray-packing puzzles, I'd recommend starting with one of the others first; the linked collection page has some recommendations.
  
  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.pieces.stl` and `${name}.tray.stl`. Optionally, you may print `${name}.lid.stl` as well, which is a lid that fits over the tray for easy storage.
