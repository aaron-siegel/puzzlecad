  This is perhaps one of Coffin's lesser-known puzzles in this genre. If you're unfamiliar with his tray-packing puzzles, I'd recommend starting with one of the others first; the linked collection page has some recommendations.
  
  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.pieces.stl` and `${name}.tray.stl`. Optionally, you may print `${name}.lid.stl` as well, which is a lid that fits over the tray for easy storage.
