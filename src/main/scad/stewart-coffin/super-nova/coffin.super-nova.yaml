description: |
    Assemble the six pieces into the polyhedral shape shown on the cover photo. This is a more difficult version of Coffin's earlier design [Nova](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4130743).

    Coffin wrote of this puzzle: "It has the same assembled shape as Nova #8 - the second stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron. With six dissimilar non-symmetrical pieces, now it becomes more of a puzzle. ... But alas, it inherently has two solutions rather than the preferred just one."
    
    ### Printing Instructions
    
    
    The puzzle is modeled using [puzzlecad](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3198014), and I have included the .scad file in case you want to remix it.
