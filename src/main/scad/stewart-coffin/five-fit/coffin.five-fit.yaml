  _Five Woods_ ${stewart-coffin-tray-packing}
  
  Coffin named this puzzle _Five Woods_, because his original production used a different hardwood species for each of the five pieces. That original name is a bit of a misnomer for a 3D printed puzzle. "Five Plastics" has less of a ring to it... I prefer the name _Five Fit_ used by various other puzzle makers.
  
  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.pieces.stl` and `${name}.tray.stl`. Optionally, you may print `${name}.lid.stl` as well, which is a lid that fits over the tray for easy storage.
