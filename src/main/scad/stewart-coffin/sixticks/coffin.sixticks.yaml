  Assemble 6 pieces into the interlocking configuration shown in the cover photo.
  
  _Sixticks_ is one of many variants that coffin published on the classic _Altekruse Puzzle_. Background material on this class of puzzles can be found in the description for Coffin's related [Square Knot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4255550) puzzle. Whereas the _Altekruse Puzzle_ (and _Square Knot_) use 12 identical pieces, _Sixticks_ uses just 6 pieces, the fewest of any Altekruse variant, in three mirror-image pairs.
  
  Coffin wrote of this puzzle:
  
  "I must have made at least one experimental model about 40 years ago and found that it had one symmetrical solution, plus a second that I call a 'ghost' solution, meaning that the pieces would fit together if only it were possible to assemble.
  
  "Recently I made another set of pieces to photograph, and of course to tinker with in case something of interest may have been overlooked. This time I discovered several solutions, including some that use five of one kind of piece and one of the other. ... I enlisted the help of two puzzle experts, Nick Baxter and Bill Cutler. ... In the end we all agreed that this little novelty is not nearly as simple as I had once supposed. So now I call it _Sixticks_ and belatedly assign a serial number."

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print three copies each of `coffin.left-handed-piece.stl` and `coffin.right-handed-piece.stl`. Use one filament color for the left-handed pieces and a different color for the right-handed pieces.
  
  If you want to make Coffin's variant assemblies described above, print two additional copies of `coffin.left-handed-piece.stl` (or `coffin.right-handed-piece.stl`; it doesn't matter which). The expanded set of eight pieces can make either the 3/3 or 5/1 configurations.
