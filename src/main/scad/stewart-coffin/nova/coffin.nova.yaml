    Assemble the six pieces into the polyhedral shape shown in the cover photo.
    
    _Nova_ is derived from Coffin's earlier design [Sirius](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4122252) by adding additional ornamentation. The essential puzzle mechanism is the same, though _Nova_ has an especially striking appearance: mathematically, the assembled _Sirius_ has the shape of the first stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron, while _Nova_ has the shape of the second stellation. Coffin wrote: "The six identical pieces of _Nova_ assemble easily to form the second stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron. ... [I]t is more of a polyhedral sculpture than a puzzle."
    
    A polyhedral scuplture, then, and a fine one at that! If printed accurately in five colors (see below), it forms a striking display piece. For a more challenging assembly puzzle in the same shape, you can try printing Coffin's later variant [Super Nova](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4130744), though I'd recommend starting with this one if you're unfamiliar with this type of design.
    
    ### Printing Instructions
    
    Several variants of this puzzle are provided, with different color arrangements. The "monochrome" version is especially easy to print; just print six copies of `coffin.super-nova.solid.stl`. (You can, of course, print the copies in different colors, and you might get an interesting color pattern out of it; but the colors won't follow the geometry of the puzzle in the way Coffin intended.)
    
    To print the two-color version, print six copies of `coffin.super-nova.twocolor.base.stl` and twelve copies of `coffin.super-nova.twocolor.tip.stl`. The two- and five- color variants use "snap joints" to enable printing in multiple colors, and you will need to connect all the joints before attempting to solve the puzzle. In the two-color version, all the tips and joints are identical; just press the male connector on each tip into an indentation on of the bases. If they end up too loose, they can be reinforced with a drop of superglue (but this is usually not necessary).
    
    The five-color version is the most involved, but it has the most satisfying final appearance. Print one copy each of `coffin.super-nova.fivecolor.color-1.stl` through `coffin.super-nova.fivecolor.color-5.stl`. Color 1 is used for the bodies of each piece; colors 2 through 5 for each of four different colored tips. Then connect the snap joints as described above. In the five-color version, the joints are labeled "A" through "H" (each of the four colors comes in mirror-image pairs, for a total of eight distinct types of tip).
    
    The puzzle is modeled using [puzzlecad](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3198014), and I have included the .scad file in case you want to remix it.
