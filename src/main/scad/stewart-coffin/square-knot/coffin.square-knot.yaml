  Assemble 12 identical pieces into the interlocking configuration shown in the cover photo (_Square Knot_). For added challenge, assemble 14 such pieces into the separate configuration shown in the second photo (_Plus 2_). Additional challenges are discussed below.

  _Square Knot_ is Coffin's take on a the classic _Altekruse Puzzle_. The basic idea appeared in an 1890 patent by the Austrian designer William Altekruse, and _Square Knot_ is almost identical to that design: the only difference is that the ends of the pieces are slightly elongated in _Square Knot_, making the assembly somewhat more challenging. If printed in three colors, there is the added challenge of discovering two distinct assemblies with different color symmetries.

  Amazingly, an enlarged set of fourteen of the same identical pieces admits a different, larger assembly. Coffin published the 14-piece variant under the name _Plus 2_ (STC #57). He later described its discovery: "Once when exhibiting at a craft show, I watched with considerable interest as a bright young girl named Marjorie Hoffman was amusing herself at my booth by trying to put [_Square Knot_] together in a strange new configuration. I later completed it and found to my surprise that it required fourteen pieces rather than twelve."

  Over the years Coffin continued to experiment with further variations on the Altekruse puzzle, proposing two additional types of Altekruse piece, the _left-handed reverse_ and _right-handed reverse_ pieces. Coffin wrote:

  "For added challenge and amusement, you may substitute reverse pieces for standard pieces. The 12-piece solution can be done with ten standard pieces and two reverse pieces, or eight standard pieces and four reverse pieces. In these versions, it does not matter very much if the reverse pieces are all left-handed or a mixture of right- and left-handed, as all combinations are possible and none more difficult than another.

  "The 14-piece version may be constructed with 12 standard and two reverse, 10 standard and four reverse, or 8 standard and six reverse. In the version with six reverse pieces, the only combination which is impossible is with six identical reverse pieces."

  Well then! Print yourself a set of 20 pieces as described below, and you can enjoy _Square Knot_, _Plus 2_, and all the variants described by Coffin. I've also included a model of the classical Altekruse piece (with standard-length tips), in case anyone should want to print it - but honestly, if you print _Square Knot_ there isn't much purpose.

  But wait, there's more! Coffin also experimented with larger and smaller Altekruse variants, with 6, 24, 36, and 38 pieces, and hinted at others that are still larger. You can read about these variants in the entries for [Sixticks](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:-1) and [Extended Square Knot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:-1). Pieces for the larger and smaller variants are all printable to compatible scales, so can be combined with this set to form a variety of intermediate rectangular shapes as well, with seemingly endless opportunities for experimentation.

  ### Printing Instructions

  To make the basic _Square Knot_ puzzle, print twelve copies of `coffin.square-knot.piece.stl`. To make _Plus 2_ as well, print fourteen copies instead. For the intended color configuration, print four copies in each of three colors (or 5/5/4 for the expanded _Plus 2_ set).

  For a full set of 20 pieces that can also make Coffin's "reverse piece" variants (as described above), print fourteen copies of `coffin.square-knot.piece.stl`, five copies of `coffin.square-knot.left-handed-reverse-piece.stl`, and one copy of `coffin.square-knot.right-handed-reverse-piece.stl`. [COLORS?]

  Finally, if you wish to print the classical Altekruse puzzle, print twelve copies of `coffin.square-knot.classical-altekruse-piece.stl`. (As mentioned above, though, it doesn't have much to offer if you've already printed _Square Knot_.)
