    Assemble the eight pieces into a 4x4x4 cube.

    _Patio Block_ is classic Stewart Coffin: a simple, elegant idea gives rise to an unexpectedly challenging assembly puzzle. Coffin wrote of the ideas behind its design:
    
    "Start by joining 1x2x2 blocks all ten possible ways. Now put aside the two that are rectangular solids. Try fitting the other eight into a 4x4x4 box until you become convinced that it is impossible. Try eliminating one and duplicating another until they not only fit but do so with interesting symmetry."
    
    If you enjoy this puzzle, you might also try Coffin's related design ${link:coffin.cube-16}, an interlocking puzzle based on the same idea of joining 1x2x2 blocks.

    ### Printing Instructions

    Print either `coffin.patio-block.stl` _or_ `coffin.patio-block-smaller.stl`. I prefer the larger version, but the smaller one will use around 40% less material. Optionally, you may also print a box to hold the pieces in place in their solved state when not in use (as shown in the cover photo) - be sure to use the box model whose size matches the pieces you print.
