  Assemble the six pieces into the polyhedral shape shown in the photo.

  _Augmented Four Corners_ is a variation on Coffin's earlier design ${link:coffin.four-corners}. It has a similar shape, but the assembly is considerably more difficult. In Coffin's words: "To convert _Four Corners_ from a polyhedral sculpture into more of an assembly puzzle, blocks are added to the corners to create six dissimilar pieces with only one solution and one sliding axis."

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.pieces.stl` and `${name}.tips.stl`, each in a different filament color. You will need to use build-plate supports for `${name}.pieces.stl`. Supports are needed only along the base of the diagonal, and should not leave scars or interfere with the fit of the puzzle. Be sure to use a support overhang threshold of less than 45 degrees to ensure that supports are generated only at the base and not along the sides of the diagonal.

  This model uses "snap joints" so that it can be printed with the desired color scheme. ${snap-joints-boilerplate}
