  _Cruiser_ is one of a series of tray-packing puzzles by Stewart Coffin. (The other puzzles in the series can be found on the [Stewart Coffin Puzzles](https://www.puzzlehub.org/puzzles/stewart-coffin) collection page.) It's a delightful design, seemingly simple yet surprisingly tricky. Coffin wrote of this puzzle:

  "This little gem is a sequel to Few Tile #133 and a top favorite among my flat tray puzzles because of its deceptive simplicity. Fit the two trapezoids and two triangles into the rectangular tray. Mary and I would take one along on our various travels to entertain our companions, hence the name. Seldom could any of them solve it."
  
  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.pieces.stl` and `${name}.tray.stl`. Optionally, you may print `${name}.lid.stl` as well, which is a lid that fits over the tray for easy storage.
