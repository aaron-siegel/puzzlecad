    Assemble the five pieces into a 4x4x4 cube.

    This is an interlocking puzzle based on the same ideas as Coffin's earlier ${link:coffin.patio-block}. In Coffin's words: "It represents a conversion of Patio Block #82 from an eight-piece box-packing problem to a five piece interlocking cube."
    
    This is one of Coffin's more obscure designs, often overlooked in favor of his better-known interlocking cube puzzles such as ${link:coffin.convolution}. If it doesn't quite rise to the level of genius of Coffin's greatest designs, this is nonetheless an excellent puzzle, fun but not too difficult, and well worth the effort to print.

    ### Printing Instructions
    
    Print either `coffin.cube-16.stl` _or_ `coffin.cube-16-smaller.stl`. I prefer the larger version, but the smaller one will use around 40% less material.
