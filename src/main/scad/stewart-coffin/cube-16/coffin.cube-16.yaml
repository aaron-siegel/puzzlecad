description: |
    Assemble the five pieces into a 4x4x4 cube. This is an interlocking puzzle based on the same ideas as Coffin's earlier ${link:coffin.patio-block}. In Coffin's words: "It represents a conversion of Patio Block #82 from an eight-piece box-packing problem to a five piece interlocking cube."
    
    This is one of Coffin's more obscure designs, often overlooked in favor of his better-known interlocking cube puzzles such as ${link:coffin.convolution}. If it doesn't quite rise to the level of genius of Coffin's greatest designs, this is nonetheless an excellent puzzle, fun but not too difficult, and well worth the effort to print.
    
    UPDATED February 2020 with a new design and larger size.

    ### Printing Instructions
    
    Print either `coffin.cube-16.stl` _or_ `coffin.cube-16-smaller.stl`. I prefer the larger version, but the smaller one will use around 40% less material.
