  Assemble the three pieces into the pyramid shape shown in the photo.
  
  _Multi-Grain Burr_ is surprisingly difficult despite having only four pieces, due to the unusual shape of the assembly. It is a larger variant of Coffin's [Three-Piece Block](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3363882); if you're unfamiliar with this type of puzzle, I'd recommend starting with _Three-Piece Block_ instead.
  
  UPDATED June 2020 with a new design. The new design is functionally identical to the old one, but its appearance is considerably more faithful to Coffin's intentions.
  
  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy of `coffin.multi-grain-burr.stl`. This model uses snap joints so that the pieces can be printed without supports; for this particular puzzle, I recommend using a sturdy PLA filament (or something stronger, such as PLA+ or ABS) and/or reinforcing with glue, due to the fragile nature of some of the joints.
