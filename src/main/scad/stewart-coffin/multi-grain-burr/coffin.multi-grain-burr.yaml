  Assemble the four pieces into the unusual shape shown in the photo.
  
  _Multi-Grain Burr_ is surprisingly difficult despite having only four pieces, due to the unusual shape of the assembly. It is a larger variant of Coffin's [Three-Piece Block](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3363882); if you're unfamiliar with this type of puzzle, I'd recommend starting with _Three-Piece Block_ instead.

  UPDATED June 2020 with a new design. The new design is functionally identical to the old one, but its appearance is considerably more faithful to Coffin's intentions.
  
  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy of `coffin.${name}.pieces.stl`. This model uses snap joints so that the pieces can be printed without supports; for this particular puzzle, I recommend using a sturdy PLA filament (or something stronger, such as PLA+ or ABS) and/or reinforcing with glue, due to the fragile nature of some of the joints.

  Coffin specified that the "key piece" (the piece made from just two cubes) be made tight, so that it is less obvious how to _disassemble_ the puzzle once it's assembled. If you find that the key piece does not hold firmly in place, you can try printing `coffin.${name}.tighter-key-piece.stl` as a replacement. (I didn't want to make the tighter version the default, because printer tolerances vary.)

  For a slightly smaller version that uses less material, you can print `coffin.${name}.pieces-smaller.stl` instead (and, optionally, `coffin.${name}.tighter-key-piece-smaller`.
