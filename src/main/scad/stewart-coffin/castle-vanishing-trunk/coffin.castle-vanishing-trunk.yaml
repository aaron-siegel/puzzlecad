name: "Castle / Vanishing Trunk - Tray-packing puzzle by Stewart Coffin (STC #181-A & #181-B)"
tags: [puzzle]

targets: [pieces, tray, lid]
description: |
  Several puzzles in one: fit all five pieces into each of the three openings. Two of the openings are house-shaped but with an extra protrusion, either at the top (the chimney of the "Castle") or bottom (the "Vanishing Trunk" of a tree). Mysteriously, the same pieces can also squeeze into the third opening, which has no such protrusion, but calls for a different solution!

  _Castle / Vanishing Trunk_ is one of a series of tray-packing puzzles by Stewart Coffin. (The other puzzles in the series can be found on the [Stewart Coffin Puzzles](https://www.puzzlehub.org/puzzles/stewart-coffin) collection page.) If you're unfamiliar with his tray-packing puzzles, I'd recommend starting with one of the others first; the linked collection page has some recommendations.
  
  It was originally published as two separate designs, Castle (#181-A) and Vanishing Trunk (#181-B). Since they use the exact same set of pieces, I've chosen to combine them here in a three-in-one tray.
  
  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.pieces.stl` and `${name}.tray.stl`. Optionally, you may print `${name}.lid.stl` as well, which is a lid that fits over the tray for easy storage.
