  Akaki's Picnic is a series of packing puzzles. Pack the pieces into a basket with a special handle.

  Each puzzle uses the same basket, so you can choose to print only one basket, with multiple sets of puzzle pieces.

  Each puzzle has the same goal: pack all the pieces into the basket, up to the brim line.
