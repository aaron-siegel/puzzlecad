  Akaki's Picnic is a series of packing puzzles. Pack the pieces into a basket with a special handle.

  Each puzzle uses the same basket, so you can choose to print only one basket, with multiple sets of puzzle pieces.

  Each puzzle has the same goal: pack all the pieces into the basket, up to the brim line.

  Start with *Cake Basket*, the easiest design. Next you can try *Hamburger Basket* and *Egg Basket*, or try and solve them all in the order listen below. Each one requires a different trick to solve.

  ### List of puzzles by difficulty

  **Easy**
  - **Cake Basket**  Three symmetric pieces. This is the easiest design. (Yet not a piece of cake)
  - **Fruit Basket**  This puzzle fills the whole 27-block space, and only require a simple rotation to solve.
  - **Vegetable Basket**  Only linear moves are required to solve this puzzle. This one is somehwat tricky to unpack too.
  - **Ice Cream Basket**  An easy puzzle, but it has one movement that is not used in any of the other designs.
  Medium
  - **Hamburger Basket**  It is easy to get disoriented with the shape of the large piece in this puzzle.
  - **Salmiakki Basket**  The key to this puzzle is how to position the two small identical pieces.
  - **Subway Basket**  One of the pieces travels in an unexpected direction.
  - **Coffee Basket**  The large coffee cup piece is easy to place in the basket, but what to do with the long coffee mixer sticks?
  Difficult
  - **Chicken Basket**  At seven moves, the large piece in this puzzle has the most moves in the series for a single piece.
  - **Egg Basket**  The largest piece in this puzzle is hard enough to get in the basket on its own, but can you fit the surrounding pieces in the basket too?
  - **Sandwich basket**  The orientation is not hard to deduce, but how to get the filling inbetween the bread piece?
  - **Chocolate Basket**  You have to be careful about the order you pack these pieces in the basket.
  - **Wine Basket**  This is the hardest design. Might require some dexterity.

  This listing is part of the Printable Puzzle Project (see below).
