  Akaki's Picnic is a series of packing puzzles. Pack the pieces into a basket with a special handle.

  Each puzzle uses the same basket, so you can choose to print only one basket, with multiple sets of puzzle pieces.

  Each puzzle has the same goal: pack all the pieces into the basket, up to the brim line.

  Start with Cake Basket, the easiest design. Next you can try Egg Basket and Hamburger Basket, or try and solve them all in the order listen below.

  ### List of puzzles by difficulty

  Easy
  Cake Basket Three symmetric pieces. This is the easiest design.
  Ice Cream Basket  An easy puzzle, but it has one movement that is not used in any of the other designs.
  Fruit Basket  This puzzle fills the whole 27-block space, and only require a simple rotation to solve.
  Vegetable Basket  Only linear moves are required to solve this puzzle. *Note! This puzzle has a second solution, where there are visible holes on the top surface.
  Medium
  Hamburger Basket  This is my favorite one, because I constantly get disoriented with the confusingly shaped pieces in the puzzle. It is the only one I can never remember the solution to.
  Salmiakki Basket  The key to this puzzle is how to position the two small identical pieces.
  Subway Basket One of the pieces travels in an unexpected direction.
  Coffee Basket The large coffee cup piece is easy to place in the basket, but what to do with the long coffee mixer sticks?
  Difficult
  Egg Basket  The largest piece in this puzzle is hard enough to get in the basket on its own, but can you fit the surrounding pieces in the basket too?
  Sandwich basket 
  Chicken Basket  The large chicken wing piece does a surprising movement.
  Chocolate Basket  Think hard about the order you pack these pieces in the basket.
  Wine Basket This is the hardest design. Might require some dexterity.

  This listing is part of the Printable Puzzle Project (see below).

  ### Printing Instructions

  All files can be printed without supports.

  Print akakis-picnic-basket.stl and akakis-picnic-basket-handle.stl. Glue the handle to the basket with superglue.

  Some of the puzzle designs have snap connectors. You must snap the pieces together before attempting the puzzle. Use glue if neccessary.
