  The NOS Burr Series is a set of seven interlocking puzzles by Gregory Benedetti. The goal of each puzzle is the same: assemble six pieces into the familiar shape of an ordinary six-piece burr.
  
  These are no ordinary six-piece burrs, however. Instead of the usual rectilinear cuts found in traditional burr puzzles, the NOS ("New Old School") burrs feature unusual diagonal cuts, yielding an astonishing variety of solving experiences that will continually surprise you. Each one is unique; among them you will find triple and quadruple coordinate motion, multiple consecutive coordinate motions, surprising reversals, and an unusual rotation thrown in for good measure. These are some of the most delightful puzzle designs that I have ever encountered.

  Be advised that these are quite difficult puzzles, and they are likely to challenge even experienced puzzle solvers. If you are unfamiliar with burr puzzles, I strongly advise starting with simpler designs such as those in the ${link:starter-burr-set}. However, if you feel up to the challenge, you will not regret embarking on this journey. I can assure you (from personal experience) that it is indeed possible to solve them all as pure assembly puzzles, without any hints or computer aids. If you get desperate, Kevin Sadler has created solution videos for all seven; search for them on YouTube.
  
  These puzzles are quite sensitive to tolerances. If printed too tight, they have a tendency to lock up and become frustrating to use. Therefore, I have modeled them all to be slightly on the loose side. If you want to try printing them tighter, you can try printing the `tighter` variants instead (`${name}.nos1-compressed-tighter.stl`, etc). Similarly, if you find they are too tight for comfort, try the `looser` variants.

  You can find more information about these fascinating designs in the following article by Frans de Vreugd:

  ### Printing Instructions

  For puzzle #1 and #2, print three copies of `${name}.nos1-compressed.stl` and `${name}.nos2-transfer.stl`, respectively. For each of the others, print just one copy of the appropriate `stl` file (`${name}.nos3-round-trip.stl` through `${name}.nos7-seizaine.stl`). They can all be printed without supports; two of the pieces (one each in puzzles #4 and #6) have an interior overhang that is comfortably accommodated by most printers' bridging capabilities.

  Puzzles #1 and #2 use "snap joints" to model pieces with non-bridgeable overhang. ${snap-joints-boilerplate}
