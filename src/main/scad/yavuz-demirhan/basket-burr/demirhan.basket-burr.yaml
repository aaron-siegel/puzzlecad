description: |
  Assemble four interlocking pieces into a basket-shaped frame.

  The assembled shape of _Basket Burr_ appears to be an ordinary six-piece burr sitting freely in a tray. But two of the "pieces" are permanently attached to the tray, forming a basket-shaped frame that the other four must be maneuvered into. With an easy Level 4.5 solution, _Basket Burr_ is a fun and clever design that will appeal to both novice and experienced puzzle solvers.

  Thanks to Yu Chih Chang for contributing the model for this design.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.basket.stl`, `${name}.handle.stl`, and `${name}.pieces.stl`. To get the intended color scheme, print `${name}.handle.stl` and `${name}.pieces.stl` in the same color, and `${name}.basket.stl` in a different color.

  The basket uses "snap joints" so that it can be printed without supports. After you print it, first connect all the joints before attempting to solve the puzzle. Snap each male connector into a corresponding female connector (for example, the male connector labeled "A" should connect to the female connector with a matching "A" label on the interior). __For easiest assembly, be sure to snap the two components of the handle together before attaching them to the basket base.__

  The joints are designed to be tight, and depending on the printer and filament used, you may need to hammer them into place. If they come out too loose, a drop of superglue will make them more solid (in most cases this shouldn't be necessary, but unfortunately tolerances vary across printers and filaments). The snap joint concept is discussed further in this tutorial: [Getting Started with Puzzle Printing](https://www.puzzlehub.org/tutorials/getting-started).
