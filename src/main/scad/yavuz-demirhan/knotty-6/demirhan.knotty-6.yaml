    Assemble six identical pieces into the symmetric shape shown in the cover photo.

    _Knotty 6_ is a lovely, elegant design. Six pieces all have the same flat, simple shape, yet they interlock in a surprising way. As a puzzle it's not difficult; it's also extremely easy to print, so I can recommend it to anyone who might be interested, regardless of experience level with puzzles or 3D printing.

    A variant is included (see instructions below) in which one of the pieces is unlike the others. In addition to the basic _Knotty 6_ shape, the variant pieces can form an alternate assembly, as shown in the second photo.

    ### Printing Instructions
    
    To print the original version of _Knotty 6_, just print six copies of `demirhan.knotty-6.piece.stl`. To get the color configuration shown, print two copies in each of three colors.

    To print the variant, substitute `demirhan.knotty-6.alternate-piece.stl` for one of the six copies: that is, print five copies of `demirhan.knotty-6.piece.stl` and one copy of `demirhan.knotty-6.alternate-piece.stl`. (If you've already printed the original version, then you can print just the one extra piece and use it interchangeably with five of the originals.)
    
    Finally, you may optionally substitute `demirhan.knotty-6.inscribed-piece.stl` for one of the pieces. The difference is purely aesthetic; `inscribed-piece` has the name of the puzzle and designer printed on it, as shown in the photos.
