description: |
  Assemble six interlocking pieces in an unusual configuration around a cube-shaped central block, as shown in the photo.

  With a very manageable Level 8.6 solution and only one false assembly, _Bandido_ is a fun and approachable interlocking puzzle, and it has a striking appearance once assembled.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.central-piece.stl` and `${name}.other-pieces.stl`, ideally in two contrasting colors.

  The central piece uses "snap joints" so that it can be printed without supports. ${snap-joints-boilerplate}
