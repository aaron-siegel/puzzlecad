  Pack six pieces into a box with two curiously shaped triangular openings.

  _BDSM_ is one of a series of challenging packing puzzles by László Molnár. This one is quite hard. You have been warned! If you want a gentler introduction to Molnár's puzzles, check out our recommendations in the [László Molnár puzzles](https://www.puzzlehub.org/puzzles/l%C3%A1szl%C3%B3-moln%C3%A1r) collection.

  This listing is part of the Printable Puzzle Project (see below). The model was developed and contributed to PPP by Yu Chih Chang.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `molnar.bdsm.box.stl` and `molnar.bdsm.pieces.stl`. Ideally, print the box in one filament color and the pieces in a different color.

  You will need to assemble the box before attempting to solve the puzzle. To assemble the box, attach the three box frame components together by inserting the circular pins on one component into the indentations on the next, as shown in the photo. To ensure they remain securely together, put a drop of superglue into each indentation before attaching them.
