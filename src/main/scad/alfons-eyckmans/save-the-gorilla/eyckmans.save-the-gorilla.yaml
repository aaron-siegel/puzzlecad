  Disassemble the 19-piece interlocking shape to remove the gorilla-shaped piece trapped inside.

  _Save the Gorilla_ is one of Alfons Eyckmans's popular "Burr Zoo" puzzles, in which ordinary-looking burr shapes conceal animal figurines trapped inside. (In the photo, the gorilla shape is shown standing outside the puzzle, but in the assembled state it will be concealed within.) This is a challenging puzzle for experienced puzzle solvers, requiring a total of 70 moves for the disassembly.

  It's intended as a take-apart puzzle, but in order to attempt it as such, you will first need to assemble it. Unless your puzzle-solving skills are far greater than mine, you'll probably want to use software such as BurrTools to do so, and I've included the BurrTools (xmpuzzle) file provided by Alfons. _Save the Gorilla_ is quite a challenge to assemble, even with BurrTools! (Please do not contact me for the solution; if you don't have experience using BurrTools, you might be better off starting with one of the less complex designs in the Printable Puzzle Project - see below.)
