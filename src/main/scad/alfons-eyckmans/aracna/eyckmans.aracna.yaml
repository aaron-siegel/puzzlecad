  Disassemble the 13-piece interlocking shape to remove the spider-shaped piece trapped inside.

  _Aracna_ is one of Alfons Eyckmans's popular "Burr Zoo" puzzles, in which ordinary-looking burr shapes conceal animal figurines trapped inside. This is a challenging puzzle for experienced puzzle solvers.

  It's intended as a take-apart puzzle, but in order to attempt it as such, you will first need to assemble it. Unless your puzzle-solving skills are far greater than mine, you'll probably want to use software such as BurrTools to do so, and a BurrTools (xmpuzzle) file is included. (Please do not contact me for the solution; if you don't have experience using BurrTools, you might be better off starting with one of the less complex designs in the Printable Puzzle Project - see below.)

  Tom Burns contributed the models and photographs for this design to PPP.
