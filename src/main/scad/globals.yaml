    The puzzle is modeled using [puzzlecad](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3198014), and I have included the .scad file in case you want to remix it.

snap-joints-boilerplate: |
    After you print it, first connect all the joints before attempting to solve the puzzle. Snap each male connector into a corresponding female connector (for example, the male connector labeled "A" should connect to the female connector with a matching "A" label on the interior).

    The joints are designed to be tight, and depending on the printer and filament used, you may need to hammer them into place. If they come out too loose, a drop of superglue will make them more solid (in most cases this shouldn't be necessary, but unfortunately tolerances vary across printers and filaments). The snap joint concept is discussed further in this blog post: [Adventures in 3D Puzzle Printing](https://normalplay.blogspot.com/2019/01/adventures-in-3d-puzzle-printing.html).

box-assembly-boilerplate: |
    The cap and box are modeled separately so that the puzzle can be printed without supports. After printing, first attach the cap to the box before attempting to solve the puzzle. To attach the cap, put a drop of glue into each of the four guide holes on the cap, and fit the four raised cylinders on the box into them. ([Ordinary superglue](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LGPD64) works great with PLA filament.) Once the glue is dry, you're ready to go!
