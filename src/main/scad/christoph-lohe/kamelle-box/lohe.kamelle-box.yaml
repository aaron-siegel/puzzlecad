description: |
  Pack three pieces into a rectangular box with an obstructed opening.

  _Kamelle Box_ is a fun design with a simple goal: maneuver all three pieces into the box. But the opening is small, and you will have to make use of a mysterious second opening on the bottom of the box ... It's not an especially difficult puzzle, but the solution is clever and entertaining.
