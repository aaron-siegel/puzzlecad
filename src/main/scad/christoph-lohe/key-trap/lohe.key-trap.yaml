  Assemble the various pieces into the lock shape shown in the cover photo.

  With a difficult level 26 solution, _Key Trap_ is a complex puzzle that will challenge even experienced puzzle solvers. You may need software such as BurrTools to help put it together; at least, assembling it unassisted is beyond my own abilities. Once in its assembled state, it makes a fun take-apart puzzle.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.frame.stl`, `${name}.shackle.stl`, `${name}.pieces.stl`, and `${name}.key.stl`.

  This design uses snap joints so that it may be printed without supports. ${snap-joints-boilerplate}
