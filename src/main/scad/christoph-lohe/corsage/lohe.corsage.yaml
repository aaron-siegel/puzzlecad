  Assemble six interlocking pieces into an unusual frame.

  _Corsage_ is a lovely and unusual interlocking design by Christoph Lohe. With a Level 19 solution, it is a challenging, but still feasible, assembly puzzle.

  Thanks to Yu Chih Chang for contributing the model for this design.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.frame_components_1.stl`, `${name}.frame_components_2.stl`, `${name}.pieces_color_1.stl`, and `${name}.pieces_color_2.stl`. You may choose between two different color schemes:

  * The two-color version shown in the photos has a striking mixed-color frame. Print `${name}.frame_components_1.stl` and `${name}.pieces_color_1.stl` in one color, and `${name}.frame_components_2.stl` and `${name}.pieces_color_2.stl` in a different color.
  * A more traditional three-color version has a solid-color frame and two different piece colors. Print `${name}.frame_components_1.stl` and `${name}.frame_components_2.stl` in _the same_ color, `${name}.pieces_color_1.stl` in a second color, and `${name}.pieces_color_2.stl` in the third color.

  The frame uses "snap joints" so that it can be printed without supports. After you print it, first connect all the joints before attempting to solve the puzzle. Snap each male connector into a corresponding female connector (for example, the male connector labeled "A" should connect to the female connector with a matching "A" label on the interior). __For easiest assembly, first assemble the frame components into two chains of three pieces each, then mate the two chains together.__

  The joints are designed to be tight, and depending on the printer and filament used, you may need to hammer them into place. If they come out too loose, a drop of superglue will make them more solid (in most cases this shouldn't be necessary, but unfortunately tolerances vary across printers and filaments). The snap joint concept is discussed further in this tutorial: [Getting Started with Puzzle Printing](https://www.puzzlehub.org/tutorials/getting-started).
