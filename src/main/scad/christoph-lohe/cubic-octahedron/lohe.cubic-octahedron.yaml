  Assemble the four pieces into the unusual octahedral shape shown in the photo.

  _Cubic Octahedron_ is a successor of sorts to Stewart Coffin's iconic puzzles ${link:coffin.three-piece-block} and ${link:coffin.multi-grain-burr}. It uses the same geometry as Coffin's earlier designs, but is a step up in difficulty, requiring several moves to get the last piece in. If you're unfamiliar with this type of design, I'd recommend starting with Three-Piece Block as a warm-up before attempting to tackle this one.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy of `${name}.stl`. This model uses snap joints so that the pieces can be printed without supports; for this particular puzzle, I recommend using a sturdy PLA filament (or something stronger, such as PLA+ or ABS) and/or reinforcing with glue, due to the fragile nature of some of the joints.

  For a slightly smaller version that uses less material, you can print `${name}-smaller.stl` instead.
