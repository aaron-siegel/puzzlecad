  Remove the four pieces from the rectangular frame.

  _Rectangle Block_ is a challenging Level 29 burr puzzle in an unusual frame. This one is for experienced puzzle solvers! It is intended to be solved as a disassembly (take-apart) puzzle, and the model is designed to make this possible - read the printing instructions _carefully_.

  ### Printing Instructions

  Print one copy each of `${name}.frame.stl`, `${name}.frame-cap.stl`, `${name}.pieces-1.stl`, and `${name}.pieces-2.stl`. To get the checker pattern shown in the photo, print `pieces-1` and `pieces-2` in separate colors. I recommend printing `pieces-1` in a sturdy filament such as PLA+, since the joints may be fragile.

  Now assemble the two pieces from `pieces-1` by snapping the joints together. For this puzzle, I recommend reinforcing them with glue. __DO NOT ASSEMBLE THE FRAME YET!__ Snap each male connector into a corresponding female connector (for example, the male connector labeled "A" should connect to the female connector with a matching "A" label on the interior). The joints are designed to be tight, and depending on the printer and filament used, you may need to hammer them into place. The snap joint concept is discussed further in this tutorial: [Getting Started with Puzzle Printing](https://www.puzzlehub.org/tutorials/getting-started).

  Now put the puzzle into its assembled state as follows.

  * Each piece is labeled on its corners with letters W, X, Y, and/or Z. These are guides that indicate how the pieces fit together in their assembled state.
  * Find the two pieces with a Z on the corner and align them so the Z's exactly touch. You'll see a W and Y meet on their sides, as shown in the second-to-last photo.
  * Do the same thing with the two pieces with an X on the corner - align them so the X's exactly touch.
  * Place the two pairs of pieces into the frame, aligned so the W's and Y's touch. You should see the assembly shown in the last photo.
  * Finally, snap the lid into place over the entire assembly. You're ready to attempt the puzzle!
