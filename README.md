# puzzlecad

puzzlecad is a software library for modeling 3D printable interlocking puzzles. It translates simple expressions describing the geometry of puzzle pieces, such as this:

```burr_piece("xxx|.x.");```

into fully rendered models for 3D printing. puzzlecad has a rich feature set for designing puzzles with a variety of geometries and customizing their appearance.
